# j2p

A simple Python package to convert Jupyter notebooks to Python scripts.

If you find yourself needing to convert a notebook to a Python script, you likely turn to nbconvert. However, this often results in a script with annoying cell separators. Consequently, you may try manually removing these extra lines to focus solely on the code itself.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jupy
```

## Usage

```python
j2p example.ipynb
```
